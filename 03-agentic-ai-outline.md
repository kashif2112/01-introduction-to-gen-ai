# 3. Toward AI Agents: An Outline for Level 2

The modules in this Level 1 repository culminate in an appreciation of how generative models work and how to interact with large language models.  The next frontier of AI combines generative abilities with **agency**—the capacity to plan, act and adapt autonomously.  This document introduces the concept of **agentic AI** and sketches what you can expect in the follow‑up repository.

## 3.1 What is agentic AI?

Traditional AI and generative models are largely passive: they analyse data or generate content in response to prompts.  **Agentic AI** refers to systems that not only generate content but also **perform actions**, **make decisions** and **pursue goals** over time.  The Sumo Logic guide describes this evolution as a shift from passive intelligence to proactive digital agents: agentic systems combine generative AI with planning, memory and initiative, functioning more like an extra teammate or **force multiplier**【465927400215880†L338-L346】.  In these systems, models do not simply answer questions; they autonomously decide what to do next based on a goal.

Agentic AI often integrates several capabilities:

* **Reasoning and planning:** The system can break down a high‑level objective into actionable steps and determine the order in which to execute them.
* **Memory:** The agent maintains a working memory of past interactions or retrieved information, allowing it to reference previous context when making decisions.
* **Tool use:** Agents can call external functions or access APIs (for example, running a search or retrieving data) to accomplish tasks.

These elements transform a generative model into a self‑directed problem solver.

## 3.2 Why agents matter

Agentic AI is poised to amplify productivity by automating complex workflows that require multiple steps.  The Sumo Logic article notes that agentic systems can bridge the gap between passive intelligence and proactive assistants, combining planning and memory with generative capabilities【465927400215880†L338-L351】.  Think of an agent that reads your emails, drafts replies, schedules meetings and books travel—all while adapting to changing constraints.  Such systems are still in their infancy but represent a natural extension of the technologies you have learned about in this repository.

## 3.3 What’s next?

The follow‑up Level 2 repository will explore agentic AI in depth.  Topics will include:

* **Agent architectures:** Frameworks such as **ReAct**, **Auto‑GPT** and other open‑source agents, which couple language models with tools and memory.
* **Planning algorithms:** Techniques for goal decomposition and action sequencing.
* **Memory management:** Approaches to storing and retrieving context over long interactions.
* **Safety and alignment:** Ensuring that agents act in accordance with user intents and ethical guidelines.

By building on the foundations of machine learning, deep learning and generative models, you will be ready to design and deploy autonomous agents that work alongside humans.  The journey continues!
