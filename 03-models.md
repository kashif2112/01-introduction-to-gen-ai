# 3. Major Generative Model Families
Generative AI is not a single algorithm; rather, it encompasses a family of architectures that learn data distributions in different ways.  This section introduces the most prominent model types and highlights how they operate and where they are used.
## 3.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
**GANs** were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014 and have since become one of the most celebrated generative architectures.  In a GAN, two neural networks—the *generator* and the *discriminator*—compete with each other: the generator tries to produce samples that look real, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real samples from fake ones.  This adversarial game forces the generator to improve until its outputs are nearly indistinguishable from the training data.  GANs are used for image synthesis, style transfer, semantic image editing, super‑resolution and even medical image conversion.
**Challenges:** Training GANs can be unstable.  Phenomena like **mode collapse**, where the generator produces limited variations, and **vanishing gradients**, where the discriminator becomes too strong and stops providing useful feedback, make GANs notoriously hard to tune.
## 3.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
**VAEs** combine probabilistic modeling with deep learning.  They consist of an **encoder** that compresses input data into a latent representation and a **decoder** that reconstructs the data from this latent space.  The latent space is continuous and regularized so that sampling from it yields meaningful reconstructions.  Introduced in 2013 by Kingma and Welling, VAEs maximize a variational lower bound on the data likelihood, enabling efficient training with stochastic gradient descent.  Because the decoder learns to reconstruct inputs, VAEs can generate new data by sampling latent vectors and decoding them, making them useful for image generation, anomaly detection and representation learning.
## 3.3 Autoregressive Models
**Autoregressive** generative models produce sequences one element at a time.  They model the conditional probability of each element given the preceding elements and generate new samples by iteratively predicting the next element.  According to the Databricks primer, autoregressive models generate data sequentially and are commonly used for text generation (e.g., language models), music composition and other sequence‑generation tasks.
Familiar examples include **GPT‑style** language models, where the probability of a sentence is factorized into a product of conditional probabilities of each word.  Because they generate samples step by step, autoregressive models can capture complex dependencies but are relatively slow at inference compared with other architectures.
## 3.4 Diffusion Models
**Diffusion models**, also known as de‑noising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), provide a different route to generative modeling.  They consist of a *forward diffusion* process, where random Gaussian noise is gradually added to training data until it becomes unstructured noise, and a *reverse diffusion* process, where a neural network learns to reconstruct the original data from noise.  Once trained, diffusion models can create new data by starting from pure noise and running the learned reverse process.  These models have recently achieved state‑of‑the‑art results in image generation and are popular in tools like **Stable Diffusion** and **Sora**.
## 3.5 Transformer‑based Models and Large Language Models (LLMs)
The **Transformer** architecture revolutionized generative modeling in natural language processing.  Introduced in the 2017 paper *“Attention is All You Need”*, transformers discard recurrence and rely on **self‑attention** mechanisms to determine how different parts of an input sequence relate to each other.  This architecture scales well and handles long‑range dependencies, making it the foundation for large language models like **GPT‑3** and **GPT‑4**.
Transformers learn to predict the next token in a sequence (an autoregressive objective) but differ from classic autoregressive models in how they model context.  They also support **parallel training**, which allows them to be trained efficiently on very large datasets.  Beyond text, transformer variants have been applied to images (Vision Transformers), code, molecular graphs and multimodal data.  As a result, transformer‑based models power many of today’s generative AI applications, including chatbots, coding assistants and text‑to‑image systems.
## 3.6 Putting it together
These model families are not mutually exclusive: diffusion models can incorporate transformer components, GANs can include autoregressive decoders and VAEs can be combined with adversarial training.  Understanding the core mechanisms of each architecture will help you choose the right model for your task and appreciate the diversity of techniques in generative AI.
