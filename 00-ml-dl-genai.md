# 0. From Machine Learning to Generative AI

Generative AI sits at the end of a long chain of advances in artificial intelligence.  To appreciate why generative models are so powerful, it helps to understand how they relate to **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)**.  This module describes the nested hierarchy of AI techniques and compares the goals of machine learning and generative AI.

## 0.1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the broad umbrella of techniques that enable computers to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.  Within AI lies **machine learning**, which teaches algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions from data.  The Sumo Logic guide describes this relationship as a set of nested dolls: artificial intelligence is the largest category, machine learning is a subset of AI, and deep learning is a further subset of machine learning【465927400215880†L154-L161】.  In other words, all deep‑learning systems are machine‑learning systems, but not every machine‑learning model qualifies as deep learning【465927400215880†L154-L161】.

**Machine learning** uses statistical algorithms to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  The OurCrowd overview explains that ML algorithms analyse large datasets to produce predictions or decisions【335300288061438†L111-L118】.  These algorithms automatically learn rules from data and can improve over time as they see more examples【335300288061438†L111-L124】.  Common tasks include classification, regression and clustering.  Machine learning excels at **predictive maintenance, fraud detection and recommendation systems**【335300288061438†L96-L103】.

**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that builds models from multi‑layered neural networks (artificial neural networks).  Each layer extracts increasingly abstract representations of the input, enabling the network to learn complex patterns directly from raw data.  Deep learning’s power comes from its depth: adding layers or enlarging them increases the capacity of the model and allows it to model complicated functions【465927400215880†L252-L287】.  Because these models can learn hierarchies of information automatically, deep learning underpins many recent breakthroughs such as self‑driving cars, computer vision and large language models【465927400215880†L252-L264】.

## 0.2 What is generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to models that can produce new content—images, text, audio or code—that resembles their training data.  While traditional ML models aim to predict labels or identify patterns, generative models learn the *joint* distribution of the data and can sample from it.  The Sumo Logic guide notes that deep learning forms the base for generative AI and that generative AI outputs new data designed to resemble the training data using neural networks【465927400215880†L303-L320】.  A key training strategy uses two neural networks—a **generator** and a **discriminator**—that compete, enabling the generator to produce increasingly realistic outputs【465927400215880†L320-L324】.

Generative AI uses **deep learning** architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models and transformer‑based autoregressive models.  Because the models learn the structure of the data rather than just class boundaries, they can synthesise realistic artifacts.  Generative models often require a **prompt**—a human‑provided description or example—that guides the output【335300288061438†L150-L160】.

## 0.3 Comparing machine learning and generative AI

Machine learning and generative AI both fall under the AI umbrella but pursue different goals.  Machine learning algorithms analyse data to find patterns and make predictions; generative AI systems create new data.  The OurCrowd comparison highlights these distinctions: ML algorithms are trained using techniques such as supervised learning and excel at predictive maintenance, fraud detection and recommendation systems, whereas generative AI relies on GANs and VAEs to generate content and is better suited for creative tasks like image and video generation, text generation and product design【335300288061438†L90-L103】.  Machine learning models learn from data to improve predictions over time【335300288061438†L111-L124】, while generative AI models learn from data in order to synthesise new samples【335300288061438†L150-L160】.

Understanding this hierarchy clarifies why generative AI could only emerge after advances in deep learning.  As you progress through this repository, you will build on these foundations to explore the architectures and applications that make generative models possible.
