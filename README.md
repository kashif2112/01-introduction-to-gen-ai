# Generative AI Level 1: Foundations
This repository serves as the **Level 1** entry point for learning about generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).  It covers the core concepts of generative models, contrasts them with discriminative models, introduces the main model families (GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models, diffusion models and transformers), surveys real‑world applications and discusses ethical and practical challenges.  The goal is to give newcomers a solid foundation before diving into more advanced topics.

## Getting started
To build a solid foundation, we recommend the following study order:
1. **Start with AI hierarchy:** Read `docs/00‑ml‑dl‑genai.md` to understand how artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and generative AI fit together.  This section clarifies the nested relationship between these fields and compares predictive machine‑learning tasks with generative modelling.
2. **Learn about deep learning:** Move on to `docs/01‑deep‑learning‑evolution.md` to explore the main deep‑learning algorithm families—multilayer perceptrons, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and transformers—and how the transformer architecture revolutionised sequence modelling.
3. **Explore large language models and prompts:** Study `docs/02‑llms‑prompt‑engineering.md` to see how large language models work and learn best practices for crafting prompts that guide their behaviour.
4. **Preview agents:** Read `docs/03‑agentic‑ai‑outline.md` for an overview of agentic AI and to see how generative models can be extended into autonomous systems.
5. **Understand generative AI:** Continue with `docs/01‑introduction.md` to delve into what generative AI is, how it emerged and the motivations behind it.  This section introduces key terminology and provides historical context.
6. **Understand generative vs. discriminative:** Consult `docs/02‑generative‑vs‑discriminative.md` to see how generative models differ mathematically from discriminative models.  Understanding this distinction helps clarify why generative AI is unique.
7. **Explore model families:** Study `docs/03‑models.md` to learn how different generative architectures work and what problems they solve.  Each subsection includes citations and examples to reinforce your understanding.
8. **Look at applications:** Read `docs/04‑applications.md` to see how generative models are applied to images, text, audio, code and other domains.  Use cases are drawn from current research and industry practice.
9. **Reflect on ethics and challenges:** Finish with `docs/05‑ethics‑and‑challenges.md` to appreciate the societal impacts and technical hurdles associated with generative AI.
10. **Dig deeper:** Use the curated links in `docs/06‑resources.md` for further study and hands‑on experimentation.
