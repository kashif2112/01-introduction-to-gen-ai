## Foundational research papers

| Paper | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| **“Auto‑Encoding Variational Bayes” (Kingma & Welling, 2013)** | Introduced the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework and demonstrated how deep generative models could be trained efficiently【572714771079252†L245-L271】. |
| **“Generative Adversarial Nets” (Goodfellow et al., 2014)** | Proposed the GAN architecture, framing generative modeling as a minimax game between a generator and a discriminator【572714771079252†L166-L173】. |
| **“Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017)** | Introduced the transformer architecture, which uses self‑attention mechanisms and underlies modern large language models【572714771079252†L203-L219】. |

## Books and courses

* **Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville)** – Chapter 20 discusses generative models, including variational autoencoders and GANs.  A free draft is available online.
* **Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction (Kevin P. Murphy)** – Covers unsupervised and generative modeling with a solid theoretical foundation.
* **Coursera – *Generative Adversarial Networks* (DeepLearning.AI)** – A practical course that guides learners through building and training GANs.
* **Fast.ai – *Practical Deep Learning for Coders*** – Includes sections on generative models and shows how to implement them using modern frameworks.

## Tools and libraries

* **PyTorch** – A popular deep‑learning framework that supports building custom generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models).
* **Hugging Face Transformers** – Provides pre‑trained transformer and diffusion models and includes examples for text, image and audio generation.
* **Stable Diffusion / Diffusers** – Open‑source implementations of diffusion models for generating images from text prompts.

These resources will help deepen your understanding and provide hands‑on experience with generative AI.  As the field evolves rapidly, staying current through research papers, blog posts and community forums is essential.
